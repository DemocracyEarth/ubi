# UBI Coin

A standard for Universal Basic Income tokens. 

Built in collaboration with [Kleros](https://github.com/kleros) and the [Proof of Humanity](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity) project.

## Features

- ERC20 token that can `mint` new supply for verified humans over time at a given rate. 
- Interfaces with `ProofOfHumanity` to get curated list of verified humans.
- Issuance rate —a. k. a. inflation— is subject to governance.
- Token has `burn` function —a. k. a. deflation— that can be triggered by users or a DAO.
- `Snapshot` event emitted to ease use of token for governance purposes.

Built with [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) and [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/openzeppelin) contracts.
